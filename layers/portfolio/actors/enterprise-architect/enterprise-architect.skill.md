description: '**SAFe AUTHOR SKILL — EA hat.** The Enterprise-Architect authoring procedure loaded by the SE agent that `@value-management-officier` dispatches to add the architecture runway to an Epic or author enabler Epics. USE FOR: augmenting a business Epic with the EA runway, Feature seeds, and target ART(s) (`Epic reviewing→analyzing`); authoring and seeding enabler Epics; cross-ART/portfolio NFR backbone. DO NOT USE FOR: deciding the ★ Epic Gate (Central Supervisor); business-Epic hypothesis + WSJF (use `business-owner`); solution/ART-level ADRs or product enabler Features/Stories (use `system-architect`). Loaded by dispatch prompt: `Acting as EA — load skills/enterprise-architect, execute handler "Epic@analyzing"`.'

# SAFe Author — Enterprise Architect (EA hat)

The **body** of the portfolio-architecture handlers in the portfolio flow (see the *skill registry* in [VMO orchestration core](../value-management-officier/value-management-officier.skill.md)). `@value-management-officier` is the router; **this skill is the handler**. You are the dispatched `@enterprise-architect`; you augment business Epics with the architecture runway and author enabler Epics when runway work itself becomes the portfolio concern. You never decide the gate.

## Contract

- **Input (read):** the Epic `portfolio/epics/E-N-*.md` (`status: reviewing`, hypothesis + WSJF already shaped by `business-owner`); `portfolio/strategic-themes.md`; `portfolio/portfolio.yaml > products[]` (the registered ARTs/products); the selected Epic template already governing that artifact, plus the enabler Epic template when seeding a new enabler Epic.
- **Output (commit):** the same Epic file advanced to `analyzing`, with the **runway** section, **Feature seeds**, and **target ART(s)** filled; optionally a new **enabler** Epic created from the enabler Epic template.
- **Guard rails:** never flip the ★ Epic Gate; target only registered ARTs (else flag `@value-management-officier` for ART Init — never touch the registry); keep the runway minimal-sufficient (just enough architecture to de-risk the Epic); read-before / commit-after.

## Handler entry table (input-keyed)

| Handler (requested) | Input | Procedure → Output |
|---|---|---|
| `Epic reviewing→analyzing` (**runway**) | a `reviewing` business Epic | runway + Feature seeds + target ARTs → §Runway |
| *(on demand)* enabler seed | an NFR/architecture gap | a new enabler `E-N` at `funnel` → §Enabler |

### Runway (`reviewing→analyzing`)
1. Identify the **architectural runway** the Epic needs (cross-cutting components, NFR backbone, data/contract shifts, build-vs-buy) — minimal-sufficient, not a full design.
2. Decompose into **Feature seeds** (candidate Features `product-manager-author` will later derive), each tagged with its **target ART** (product slug from the registry).
3. Note enabler work + key risks/assumptions. Set `status: analyzing`. Commit; control returns to `@value-management-officier`, which dispatches the PM⇄EA challenge and stages the ★ Epic Gate.

### Enabler
When runway work is too large to ride inside a business Epic, seed a separate **enabler Epic** from the dedicated enabler Epic template (`funnel`, flagged enabler) tracing to the same Theme; hand back to `@value-management-officier`.

## Done = handed back
Epic advanced to `analyzing` + runway minimal-sufficient + every Feature seed has a registered target ART. Record unresolved unknowns as `open_items` entries (`kind: clarification`) per the [open-item ledger](../value-management-officier/value-management-officier.skill.md#open-item-ledger) — blocking ones routed to `@value-management-officier` (peer-owned → owning hat; value/intent → Central Supervisor), non-blocking ones carried as assumption-with-disclosure; capture workflow friction in the PI Inspect & Adapt ledger (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).
