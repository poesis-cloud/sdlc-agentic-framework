# Epic Template — `portfolio/epics/E-N-<slug>.md`

The portfolio-level artifact. Authored by the **Business Owner** hat (you) with the
**Enterprise Architect** hat for the architectural runway, and refined with `@business-owner`
and `@enterprise-architect` as drafters. An Epic is the **single legitimately cross-product**
artifact: it coordinates Features across one or more products. It is **portfolio-scoped**, so it
lives under `portfolio/`, never under a product slug.

There is **no PRD tier** in this methodology — the Epic carries the intent (problem, outcome
hypothesis, leading indicators) that a PRD used to hold, and it cascades to Features and Stories.

# E-1 — <title>

## Epic hypothesis statement
### Syntax
Use exactly one hypothesis block in this canonical form:
> For <customers/personas> who <do something / have a need>, the <Epic name> is a
> <class of solution> that <delivers value>. Unlike <current alternative>, our solution
> <key differentiator>. We will know we are right when we observe <leading indicators>.

(This replaces the former PRD problem/outcome sections — it IS the defined intent.)

## Outcome hypothesis & leading indicators
### Syntax
- `Leading indicator: <early measurable signal>`
- `Lagging indicator: <later outcome signal>`
- Add more bullets only when each is materially distinct.

- Leading indicator: ...
- Lagging indicator: ...

## In scope / out of scope
- In: ...
- Out (non-goals): ...

## Portfolio outcome rationale
Why this Epic matters to the portfolio in outcome terms.

## Enterprise-Architect runway (EA hat)
Cross-product architectural implications, NFR backbone, shared enablers, and which
products must build runway. Enabler Epics live mostly here. May spawn product-level ADRs
(those remain product-scoped, authored by `@system-architect`).

## Affected products & Feature seeds
### Syntax
Use one row per product seed in this form:

| Product | Feature seed (becomes F-N in that product) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <slug> | <one-line Feature intent> | ... |

Each seed becomes a product-scoped Feature (`parent_epic: E-1`). Cross-product work is
expressed as one Feature per product linked to this Epic — never a single cross-product Feature.

## MVP & pivot/persevere
The smallest Feature set (`mvp_features`) that validates the hypothesis. After the MVP,
the Business Owner decides pivot / persevere / stop at ★ Epic Gate review or Inspect & Adapt.

### Syntax
- `MVP feature set: <Feature id list or named seed list>`
- `Persevere when: <evidence threshold>`
- `Pivot or stop when: <failure signal or disconfirming evidence>`

## Dependencies / constraints
Other Epics, external systems, regulations.

## Work-item relations

Use only relation types that change planning or governance behavior.

- `depends_on` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this Epic cannot reach its MVP or expected
  outcome before the referenced Epic delivers a named capability, decision, or compliance outcome.
- `enables` — capability-unblocking relation. Use when this Epic creates runway or reusable product
  capability that another Epic or Feature is expected to consume.
- `related_to` — non-gating semantic relation. Use for overlap, shared outcome area, or adjacency
  that should be visible but must not gate ordering.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this Epic intentionally obsoletes an earlier Epic's
  intent or delivery path.

Best-practice rules:

- Prefer the narrowest true relation: if the link is hierarchy, use `products[]` + child Features,
  not `related_to`; if it is a prerequisite, use `depends_on`, not `related_to`.
- Keep each link specific and justified in prose here or in the affected section above.
- Avoid reciprocal bookkeeping unless it adds human clarity; one authoritative side is enough.
- Do not model external systems, repos, or ADRs as work-item relations here; capture those in the
  normal dependency/constraint prose.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `open_items:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../value-management-officier/value-management-officier.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this Epic's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Epic Gate; non-blocking items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a
recorded default. The ledger is kept after resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <BO|EA|PM|Security|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open
```

## Status lifecycle (Portfolio Kanban columns)

```text
funnel → reviewing → analyzing → portfolio-backlog → implementing → done
                                        ↑ ★ Epic Gate (Business-Owner approval)
```

Orthogonal flag: `blocked`.

## Transition rules

| From | To | Trigger / actor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | `funnel` | BO/EA captures a raw Epic idea |
| `funnel` | `reviewing` | RTE + PM give it an Epic hypothesis + rough WSJF |
| `reviewing` | `analyzing` | EA drafts the runway; products + Feature seeds identified |
| `analyzing` | `portfolio-backlog` | **★ Epic Gate** Business Owner approves the Epic hypothesis |
| `analyzing` | `funnel` | BO defers/declines (re-shape) |
| `portfolio-backlog` | `implementing` | First child Feature enters its product Program Kanban (`funnel`) |
| `implementing` | `done` | All child Features `done` + BO accepts the outcome (at System Demo / I&A) |
| any | `blocked` | RTE flag (orthogonal) |

## Identity / linkage

- An Epic's id `E-N` is portfolio-unique (not per product).
- A Feature points up via `parent_epic: E-N` (optional — a Feature may exist without an Epic).
- The Epic lists its products in `products[]`; child Features remain product-scoped.
- `work_item_relations` carries only typed links to other backlog units; use it for planning-governed
  relationships, not for general documentation cross-references.
