description: '**SAFe AUTHOR SKILL — BO hat.** The Business-Owner authoring procedure loaded by the SE agent that `@value-management-officier` dispatches to execute an Epic transition handler (and the backlog re-rank inside Strategic Portfolio Review). USE FOR: capturing an Epic from a Strategic Theme (`Epic ∅→funnel`); shaping its hypothesis + WSJF + leading indicators (`funnel→reviewing`); maintaining `strategic-themes.md`; WSJF re-ranking the portfolio backlog. DO NOT USE FOR: deciding the ★ Epic Gate or accepting Epic outcomes (Central Supervisor); the architecture runway (use `enterprise-architect`); Features (use `product-manager`). Loaded by dispatch prompt: `Acting as BO — load skills/business-owner, execute handler "<Epic@state>"`.'

# SAFe Author — Business Owner (BO hat)

The **body** of the Epic-shaping handlers in the portfolio flow (see the *skill registry* in [VMO orchestration core](../value-management-officier/value-management-officier.skill.md)). `@value-management-officier` is the router; **this skill is the handler**. You are the dispatched `@business-owner`; you author Strategic Themes + the Epic and hand control back — you never route, never decide the gate.

## Contract

- **Input (read):** `portfolio/strategic-themes.md`; the raw idea/mandate; the business Epic template plus the **strategic-themes** template ([strategic-themes.artifact-template.md](artifacts/strategic-themes.artifact-template.md)). For a re-rank: the whole `portfolio/epics/` set + the open workflow pain points in the PI Inspect & Adapt ledgers (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).
- **Output (commit):** `portfolio/epics/E-N-<slug>.md` (template-valid against the business Epic template) and/or an updated `strategic-themes.md`.
- **Guard rails:** never flip the ★ Epic Gate; never author enabler Epics; every Epic traces to a Strategic Theme; a *workflow* improvement is a meta-artifact change, never a product Epic; read-before / commit-after.

## Handler entry table (input-keyed)

| Handler (requested) | Input | Procedure → Output |
|---|---|---|
| `Epic ∅→funnel` (**capture**) | idea + a Strategic Theme | new `E-N` at `funnel`, traced to its Theme → §Capture |
| `Epic funnel→reviewing` (**shape**) | a `funnel` Epic | hypothesis + WSJF + leading indicators → §Shape |
| *(in Strategic Portfolio Review)* re-rank | the `epics/` set | WSJF order + pivot recommendations → §Re-rank |

### Capture (`∅→funnel`)
Create `E-N-<slug>.md` from the business Epic template. If the mandate is explicitly runway, infrastructure, compliance, or architecture enablement work, do not author it here; hand it back as EA-owned enabler work for `enterprise-architect`. Set `status: funnel`, the owning Strategic Theme, and a one-line problem/opportunity. No solutioning. Commit; control returns to `@value-management-officier`.

### Shape (`funnel→reviewing`)
Write the business hypothesis statement required by the business Epic template; add **leading indicators** + MVP scope; compute **WSJF** (record the four components). Commit; control returns to `@value-management-officier`, which dispatches `enterprise-architect` for the runway.

### Re-rank (inside Strategic Portfolio Review)
Re-order the backlog by WSJF; for each in-flight Epic recommend **pivot / persevere / stop** (the Central Supervisor decides). Output the ranking + recommendations; `strategic-portfolio-review` drives the ceremony around you.

## Done = handed back
Output committed + template-valid + every Epic Theme-traced + WSJF components present. Record unresolved unknowns as `open_items` entries (`kind: clarification`) per the [open-item ledger](../value-management-officier/value-management-officier.skill.md#open-item-ledger) — blocking ones routed to `@value-management-officier` (peer-owned → owning hat; value/intent → Central Supervisor), non-blocking ones carried as assumption-with-disclosure; capture workflow friction in the PI Inspect & Adapt ledger (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).
