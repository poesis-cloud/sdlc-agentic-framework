description: '**SAFe CEREMONY SKILL.** The ART Sync playbook (Coach Sync + PO Sync) loaded by `@release-train-engineer` per Feature (after a Feature transition or a `blocked`). USE FOR: cross-team dependency + Feature-progress reconcile during a PI; architecture-runway check while ADRs are in flight; updating program risk; removing program impediments (Feature `blocked`/unblock). DO NOT USE FOR: committing the PI (use `pi-planning`); the ★ Architecture/Demo gates (Central Supervisor); portfolio risk (use `portfolio-sync`). Loaded by `@release-train-engineer` before facilitating.'

# SAFe Ceremony — ART Sync (Coach + PO Sync)

A **reconcile** ceremony in the program / ART layer. The **normative spec** is the machine-readable **[workflow.yaml](workflow.yaml)** — every step + its `conditions` (the trigger as the first step's preconditions; the reconcile obligations as judgment conditions; the structural `after`/`input`/`output` wiring), consumed by `@release-train-engineer` and the harness (`check-step` / `check-artifact`). Load and follow it; do not restate it here.

Shared model (the open-item ledger, ★ gates, the bench, invariants, artifact templates) lives in **[RTE orchestration core](../../../actors/release-train-engineer/release-train-engineer.skill.md)**. The facilitator reconciles cross-team Feature progress + dependencies, delegates runway questions to `@system-architect`, updates ROAM risk, and flips `→blocked`/unblock only — it authors no Feature/ADR and flips no ★ gate; **only `@release-train-engineer` writes `status:`**.
Features reconciled to objectives + runway ahead of need + risks current + board refreshed.
