# Feature Template — `portfolio/<slug>/features/F-N-<slug>.md`

Authored by `@product-manager` (PM hat). A Feature optionally rolls up to a portfolio **Epic**
(`parent_epic: E-N`); there is **no PRD tier** — the defining intent lives in the Epic (or, for
standalone engineering/operability Features, in the Feature itself). Lives at
`portfolio/<slug>/features/`.

# F-12 — <title>

## Description
What is this Feature, in one paragraph.

## Acceptance criteria
### Syntax
- Use one flat bullet per criterion, labeled `AC1`, `AC2`, `AC3`, ...
- Use only one of these forms:
  - `- AC1. Given <context>, when <action>, then <observable outcome>.`
  - `- AC2. <System/work item> must <measurable rule or result>.`
- Each criterion must be independently testable.
- If `parent_epic` is set, each criterion must trace to the Epic's hypothesis or in-scope items.

- AC1. ...
- AC2. ...

## Benefit hypothesis
Why this Feature delivers value (a slice of the parent Epic's outcome hypothesis, or the
Feature's own rationale when standalone).

### Syntax
Use a short paragraph or 2-3 bullets in this form:
- Beneficiary: <who receives value>
- Outcome: <what changes when the Feature lands>
- Evidence: <how the value will be observed>

## NFR applicability / trace
List the canonical product NFRs from `architecture/nfrs.md` that apply to this Feature, plus any
Feature-specific tightening or derived verification notes. Do not redefine the product's canonical
NFR set here.

## Routing classification
- Risk: low | medium | critical — consequence of being wrong.
- Complexity: simple | involved | complex — cognitive/structural difficulty.
- Rationale: why these values are correct for this Feature.

## Dependencies
Other Features, ADRs, external systems. Cross-product coordination is expressed via the shared
parent Epic (one Feature per product), never a single cross-product Feature.

## Work-item relations

Use typed work-item relations only when they affect flow, decomposition, or governance.

- `depends_on` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this Feature should not be treated as ready or
  independently executable before the referenced Epic/Feature has produced a required outcome.
- `enables` — capability-unblocking relation. Use when this Feature intentionally opens a downstream
  Feature or Story path, especially for platform or foundation work.
- `related_to` — non-gating adjacency. Use for semantic overlap, shared user journey, or common
  outcome area that should remain visible without imposing ordering.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this Feature replaces an earlier Feature's scope or
  delivery path.

Best-practice rules:

- Use `parent_epic` for hierarchy, not `related_to`.
- Use `depends_on` only for hard ordering; if the link is informative rather than gating, use
  `related_to`.
- Prefer Feature↔Feature links for program sequencing. Link to Stories only when a committed thin
  slice is the thing actually enabled.
- Keep the inverse relation only when it adds clarity; duplicate bookkeeping is optional, not
  required.

## Architecture decision inventory
If `structurant: true`, point to the committed architecture inventory artifact
that tracks the Feature's decision units, their coverage state, linked ADRs,
waivers, and enabler follow-up. If `structurant: false`, set
`architecture_inventory: null` and omit this section.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `open_items:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../release-train-engineer/release-train-engineer.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this Feature's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Feature Gate (or the ★ Architecture Gate when `structurant: true`); non-blocking
items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a recorded default. The ledger is kept after
resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <PM|PO|SA|Security|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open

## Story breakdown (filled in step 6 by PO)
- S-101 …
- S-102 …
```

## Status lifecycle (Program Kanban columns)

```text
funnel → refined → arch-pending → ready → committed → in-progress → done
                 ↑ ★ Feature Gate  ↑ ★ Architecture Gate              ↑ ★ Demo Gate
                        (skip arch-pending if structurant=false)
```

Orthogonal flag: `blocked`.

## Transition rules

| From | To | Trigger / actor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | `funnel` | PM derives from an Epic (`parent_epic`) or files a standalone Feature |
| `funnel` | `refined` | Feature Backlog Refinement (PM completes AC + WSJF + `structurant`) |
| `refined` | `arch-pending` | **★ Feature Gate** accept + `structurant: true` + committed architecture inventory |
| `refined` | `ready` | **★ Feature Gate** accept + `structurant: false` |
| `refined` | `funnel` | **★ Feature Gate** reject (re-refine) |
| `arch-pending` | `ready` | **★ Architecture Gate** architecture packet accepted (one or more ADRs may be accepted together) |
| `arch-pending` | `refined` | Architecture packet rejected (one or more ADRs may be rejected or require reconsideration) |
| `ready` | `committed` | RTE at PI Planning |
| `committed` | `in-progress` | First child Story passes the **★ Story Gate** → enters Team Kanban `ready` |
| `in-progress` | `done` | **★ Demo Gate** Central Supervisor accepts at System Demo |
| any | `blocked` | SM/RTE flag (orthogonal) |

## Relation discipline at this layer

- `depends_on` is the authoritative program-level gating relation and should align with PI Planning
  and readiness decisions.
- `enables` captures the intended downstream unlock created by this Feature; use it to explain why a
  foundation or enabler Feature exists.
- `related_to` must never be used to smuggle a sequencing rule past refinement or planning.
