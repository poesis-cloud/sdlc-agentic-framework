# ADR-1 — <title>

## Context
Forces at play. What is structurant about the parent Feature.

## Decision scope
Name the one decision unit this ADR governs and why it is separable from
neighboring decisions.

## Linked enablers and served artifacts
- Enabler follow-up: <F-N ...>
- Served artifacts/specifications: <artifact ids, schema ids, config items, refs>
- Companion references absorbed here: <what from other standard artifacts (decision inventory / runway / NFR context) is made concrete in this ADR>

## Option evaluation criteria

Define the criteria that govern this decision before evaluating options.

| Criterion | Why it matters for this decision | Weight | How to read the score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <criterion-1> | <reason> | H/M/L or 1-5 | <higher/lower is better> |
| <criterion-2> | <reason> | H/M/L or 1-5 | <higher/lower is better> |

## Options evaluation

List only credible options.

| Option | <criterion-1> | <criterion-2> | ... | Summary assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Option A | <score + short rationale> | <score + short rationale> | ... | <net read> |
| Option B | <score + short rationale> | <score + short rationale> | ... | <net read> |
| Option C | <score + short rationale> | <score + short rationale> | ... | <net read> |

After the matrix, explain the decision logic explicitly:

1. **<Option A>** — strengths / weaknesses under the chosen criteria.
2. **<Option B>** — strengths / weaknesses under the chosen criteria.
3. **<Option C — chosen>** — strengths / weaknesses under the chosen criteria.

## Decision
State the selected option in active voice and explain why it wins under the defined criteria.

## Formal specification of the selected option

Make the chosen option concrete enough to challenge and implement.

### Normative rules
- <rule 1>
- <rule 2>

### Concrete artifacts / schemas / snippets
- Artifact: `<artifact-name>` — purpose and authoritative owner.
- Schema/config item: `<schema-or-config-id>` — required fields and validation rule.

~~~yaml
# Example snippet or minimal concrete instance
<example>
~~~

If the decision governs request/response or persisted state, include at least one full example.
If the decision governs configuration, include the normative artifact location and required fields.
If the decision governs an interface, request/outcome contract, persisted artifact bundle, or
configuration surface, distribute the relevant specification into this ADR rather than leaving it
in a separate sidecar document.

## Consequences

- Positive: ...
- Negative: ...
- Follow-up Features or ADRs to file.

## Implementation hooks

Repos and code areas impacted (must intersect parent product's `repos[]`).
```

## Status lifecycle

`proposed → ★ Architecture Gate → accepted | rejected`. `accepted` may later flip to `superseded` by a newer ADR.

Architecture Gate transition: parent Feature flips `arch-pending → ready` on `accepted`, or back to `refined` on `rejected`.
