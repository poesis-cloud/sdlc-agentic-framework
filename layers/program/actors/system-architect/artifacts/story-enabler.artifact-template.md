# Enabler Story Template — `portfolio/<slug>/sprint-N/stories/S-N-<slug>.md`

Iteration-scoped backlog contract for **enabler Stories**. Use this template when `type: enabler`.
An enabler Story is a thin technical slice that advances a parent enabler or business Feature by
removing a concrete engineering, infrastructure, exploration, or compliance blocker.

# S-101 — <title>

## Enabler story intent
This Story implements <thin technical slice>, so that <named Feature / architecture decision /
operability need> can progress.

### Syntax
Use exactly one sentence in this form:
- `This Story implements <thin technical slice>, so that <named Feature / architecture decision / operability need> can progress.`

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] AC complete and testable
- [ ] Dependencies resolved (deps Features `ready`+, ADRs `accepted`)
- [ ] Pair assignable (Driver + Navigator named)
- [ ] Estimate set

## Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
### Syntax
- Use one flat bullet per criterion, labeled `AC1`, `AC2`, `AC3`, ...
- Use only one of these forms:
  - `- AC1. Given <technical context>, when <action or condition>, then <observable result>.`
  - `- AC2. <System/control/artifact> must <measurable technical result>.`
- Each criterion must be testable and traceable to the parent Feature.

- AC1. ...
- AC2. ...

## Enabler properties
- Consuming Feature / enabler: ...
- Unblocked capability / blocker removed: ...
- Validation evidence expected before closure: ...

### Syntax
- `Consuming Feature / enabler: <id or named capability>`
- `Unblocked capability / blocker removed: <single sentence>`
- `Validation evidence expected before closure: <test, report, review, or artifact>`

## Routing classification
- Risk: low | medium | critical.
- Complexity: simple | involved | complex.
- Rationale: why these values are correct for this Story.

## Work-item relations

Use typed links to show exactly what this enabler Story removes or sequences.

- `depends_on` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this Story itself cannot proceed before another
  Story or Feature outcome lands.
- `enables` — primary enabler relation. Use to name the downstream Story or Feature whose path is
  opened once this Story is done.
- `related_to` — non-gating adjacency. Use for same-runway-area work that should stay visible but not
  ordered.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this Story intentionally absorbs prior technical
  slices.

Best-practice rules:

- At least one `enables` target is expected when the enabler exists to unblock a named downstream
  Story or Feature; otherwise explain the broader technical outcome in prose.
- Keep `adrs` for decision dependencies and `work_item_relations` for backlog-unit links.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `open_items:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../release-train-engineer/release-train-engineer.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this enabler Story's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Story Gate (DoR); non-blocking items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a
recorded default. The ledger is kept after resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <SA|Security|DevOps|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Code merged behind Central Supervisor approval (★ PR Gate)
- [ ] Tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] Coverage maintained
- [ ] `@quality-engineer` sign-off file exists: `docs/sprint-N/qa/S-101-signoff.md`
- [ ] PO confirms AC met
- [ ] Docs updated where applicable
