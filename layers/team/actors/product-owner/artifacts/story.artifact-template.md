# S-101 — <title>

## User-facing intent
As a <persona>, I want <thin slice>, so that <benefit>.

### Syntax
Use exactly one sentence in this form:
- `As a <persona>, I want <thin slice>, so that <benefit>.`

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] AC complete and testable
- [ ] Dependencies resolved (deps Features `ready`+, ADRs `accepted`)
- [ ] Pair assignable (Driver + Navigator named)
- [ ] Estimate set

## Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
### Syntax
- Use one flat bullet per criterion, labeled `AC1`, `AC2`, `AC3`, ...
- Prefer this form: `- AC1. Given <context>, when <action>, then <observable outcome>.`
- If a scenario form is unnatural, use: `- AC2. <System/UI/API> must <measurable result>.`
- Each criterion must be independently testable.

- AC1. Given ..., when ..., then ...
- AC2. ...

## Routing classification
- Risk: low | medium | critical — consequence of being wrong.
- Complexity: simple | involved | complex — cognitive/structural difficulty.
- Rationale: why these values are correct for this Story.

## Work-item relations

Use only relations that help the team decide DoR, execution order, or slice boundaries.

- `depends_on` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this Story should not pass DoR or should not
  start execution before the referenced Story or Feature delivers a required outcome.
- `enables` — slice-unblocking relation. Use when this Story deliberately prepares or unlocks a
  follow-on Story.
- `related_to` — non-gating adjacency. Use for shared workflow, common screen, or semantic coupling
  that should be visible without driving scheduling.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this Story replaces or absorbs an older Story.

Best-practice rules:

- Use `parent_feature` for hierarchy, not `related_to`.
- Prefer Story↔Story links for thin-slice sequencing inside one Feature; use Feature-level links only
  when the blocker genuinely lives above the Story.
- A `depends_on` link should normally show up in the DoR dependency check; a `related_to` link should
  not.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `open_items:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this Story's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Story Gate (DoR); non-blocking items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a
recorded default. The ledger is kept after resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <PO|SA|Security|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Code merged behind Central Supervisor approval (★ PR Gate)
- [ ] Tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] Coverage maintained
- [ ] `@quality-engineer` sign-off file exists: `docs/sprint-N/qa/S-101-signoff.md`
- [ ] PO confirms AC met
- [ ] Docs updated where applicable

## Notes / decisions during pair work
(appended by pair during DRIVE/CRITIQUE)
```

## Status lifecycle (Team Kanban columns)

```text
backlog → ready → in-progress → in-review → in-qa → awaiting-pr → done
                                                            ↑ ★ PR Gate
```

Orthogonal flag: `blocked`.

## Transition rules

| From | To | Trigger / actor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | `backlog` | PO decomposes from committed Feature |
| `backlog` | `ready` | PO confirms DoR satisfied |
| `ready` | `in-progress` | SM dispatches pair (DRIVE starts) |
| `in-progress` | `in-review` | Driver hands to Navigator (CRITIQUE) |
| `in-review` | `in-progress` | REJECT — back to DRIVE (log a swap) |
| `in-review` | `in-qa` | ACCEPT — pair commits, hands to QA |
| `in-qa` | `in-progress` | QA fails — bug report attached |
| `in-qa` | `awaiting-pr` | QA passes + PO confirms AC + PR opened |
| `awaiting-pr` | `done` | **★ PR Gate** Central Supervisor approves, RTE merges |
| any | `blocked` | SM flag (orthogonal) |
