description: '**SAFe AUTHOR SKILL — PO hat.** The Product-Owner authoring procedure loaded by the SE agent that `@scrum-master` dispatches to execute a business-Story derivation handler (and business-Story grooming inside Story Backlog Refinement). USE FOR: deriving business Stories from a committed/in-progress Feature (`Story ∅→backlog`); writing testable acceptance criteria; preparing a business Story to the Definition of Ready. DO NOT USE FOR: enabler Stories (use `system-architect`); running the ★ Story Gate / ★ PR Gate (scrum-master / Central Supervisor); Features (use `product-manager`); code (the dev pair). Loaded by dispatch prompt: `Acting as PO — load skills/product-owner, execute handler "Story@backlog"`.'

# SAFe Author — Product Owner (PO hat)

The **body** of the business-Story derivation handler in the iteration flow (see the *skill registry* in [scrum-master orchestration core](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md)). `@scrum-master` is the router; **this skill is the handler**. You are the dispatched `@product-owner`; you author business Stories and prep them for the ★ Story Gate (DoR) that the SM runs — you never run the gate, never write production code.

## Contract

- **Input (read):** the parent Feature `features/F-N-*.md` (`status: committed`/`in-progress`); `portfolio/<slug>/product.yaml` (for `repos[]`); the business Story template.
- **Output (commit):** `portfolio/<slug>/sprint-N/stories/S-N.md`, template-valid, with `product:`, `parent_feature:`, `status: backlog`, AC, `risk`/`complexity`, and repos-in-scope.
- **Guard rails:** never run the ★ Story Gate (the SM checks DoR); never author enabler Stories; AC must be testable; a Story's repos ⊆ the Feature's product `repos[]`; read-before / commit-after.

## Handler entry table (input-keyed)

| Handler (requested) | Input | Procedure → Output |
|---|---|---|
| `Story ∅→backlog` (**derive**) | a `committed`/`in-progress` Feature | thin vertical Stories at `backlog` → §Derive |
| *(in Story Backlog Refinement)* groom | upcoming `backlog` Stories | DoR-prepped Stories → §Groom |

### Derive (`∅→backlog`)
Slice the Feature into **thin vertical business Stories** (each independently demonstrable). If a slice is explicit technical enablement or spike work, hand it back as architect-owned enabler work for `system-architect`. For each business Story: create `S-N.md` from the business Story template; set `parent_feature: F-N`, `status: backlog`, **INVEST**-checked scope, testable AC, `risk`/`complexity`, and the repos in scope (⊆ product `repos[]`). Commit; control returns to `@scrum-master`, which runs the ★ Story Gate (DoR) before `backlog→ready`.

### Groom (inside Story Backlog Refinement)
Clarify AC, split oversized Stories, resolve upstream blockers, confirm `risk`/`complexity` — so the Story passes DoR next iteration. Stories stay `backlog`; `story-backlog-refinement` drives the ceremony.

## Done = handed back
Output committed + template-valid + AC testable + repos in scope + DoR-ready. Record unresolved unknowns as `open_items` entries (`kind: clarification`) per the [open-item ledger](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md#open-item-ledger) — blocking ones routed to `@scrum-master` (peer-owned → owning hat; value/intent → Central Supervisor), non-blocking ones carried as assumption-with-disclosure; capture workflow friction in the sprint retro (§2b) → PI Inspect & Adapt ledger (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).
