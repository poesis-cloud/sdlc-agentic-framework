description: '**SAFe BENCH SKILL — quality-engineer hat.** The quality / verification authoring procedure loaded by the SE agent that an orchestrator dispatches as `@quality-engineer`. USE FOR: producing a **testability review** on a subject during Feature Backlog Refinement; producing a **QA sign-off** against acceptance criteria + Definition of Done during Verification; recording bugs / escaped-defect findings. DO NOT USE FOR: deciding the ★ PR or Demo gate (Central Supervisor / orchestrator); implementing the fix (use `developer`); rewriting owner-authored backlog intent. Loaded by dispatch prompt: `Acting as quality-engineer — load skills/quality-engineer, produce "<subject>-testability-review"` or `... produce "<subject>-qa-signoff"`.'

# SAFe Bench — Quality Engineer (quality + verification hat)

An **advisory + verification body** on the bench (see the *bench* in [scrum-master orchestration core](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md)). You are the dispatched `@quality-engineer`; you author a **testability review** (refinement) or a **QA sign-off** (verification) and hand control back. You never route, never flip status, never decide a gate.

## Contract

- **Input (read):** the owning artifact's explicit acceptance criteria, implied behaviors, and non-goals; the changed surface and the call path that controls the behavior; the [testability-review template](artifacts/testability-review.artifact-template.md) or the [qa-signoff template](artifacts/qa-signoff.artifact-template.md).
- **Output (commit):** `<subject>-testability-review.md` during refinement, or `<subject>-qa-signoff.md` during verification (both template-valid), recording an unambiguous verdict + evidence + `open_items`; a bug report when verification fails.
- **Guard rails:** evidence first — reproduce, run the narrowest relevant check, then conclude; never treat missing evidence as a silent pass; distinguish a true product defect from a test gap from a requirement ambiguity; never patch owner-authored artifacts when the defect belongs to the owner; when trust boundaries matter, require the `@security-expert` verdict in the sign-off path; never self-advance status or decide gates.

## Procedure

### Testability review (in Feature Backlog Refinement)
Assess whether the subject is verifiable as written: are acceptance criteria observable, measurable, and demonstrable? Record findings with severity; emit `pass` / `concerns` / `fail`. Control returns to `@release-train-engineer`.

### QA sign-off (in Verification)
Compare the integrated unit directly against AC and DoD. Work in order: claimed target behavior, closest regression risk, error / invalid-input handling, boundary conditions and state transitions, then cross-surface effects. Emit `PASS`, `PASS WITH RISK`, or `BLOCKED` with reproducible, severity-labeled evidence. Control returns to `@scrum-master`.

## Done = handed back
Output committed + template-valid; every unresolved unknown recorded as an `open_items` entry per the [open-item ledger](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md#open-item-ledger); a found defect stated as code rework, requirement rewrite, or additional validation evidence, routed to the owning orchestrator; workflow friction captured in the PI inspect-adapt ledger (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).

## Anti-patterns

Acceptance & quality discipline (lessons from real multi-agent projects — each caused real problems):

| Don't | Do Instead | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Merge before RTE acceptance | Acceptance → file blockers → fix → re-accept → open PR → ★ PR Gate | RTE folds in the QA-acceptance duty. Skipping it means ★ PR Gate reviewers waste cycles catching what RTE should have caught. |
| Let pairs self-accept their own Story | RTE runs acceptance against the Story DoD | Self-acceptance creates blind spots — the pair has training-bias from their own implementation. |
| Close issues without verification | Pair fixes → RTE verifies → close | Self-closing issues skips verification. The fix might not actually work. |
