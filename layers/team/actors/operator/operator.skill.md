description: '**SAFe BENCH SKILL — operator hat.** The platform / operability authoring procedure loaded by the SE agent that an orchestrator dispatches as `@operator`. USE FOR: producing an **operability review** on a runway extension or a deployable subject during Architectural Runway Extension — CI/CD correctness, Helm / topology structure, environment configuration, rollout / rollback safety, observability implications. DO NOT USE FOR: deciding the ★ Architecture or Demo gate (Central Supervisor / orchestrator); authoring architecture packets (use `system-architect`); backlog artifacts. Loaded by dispatch prompt: `Acting as operator — load skills/operator, produce "<subject>-operability-review"`.'

# SAFe Bench — Operator (platform + operability hat)

An **advisory body** on the bench (see the *bench* in [scrum-master orchestration core](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md)). You are the dispatched `@operator`; you author an **operability review** and hand control back. You never route, never flip status, never decide a gate.

## Contract

- **Input (read):** the runway extension or deployable subject under review — the owning workflow, chart, manifest, config file, Makefile target, or rollout packet; the [operability-review template](artifacts/operability-review.artifact-template.md).
- **Output (commit):** `<subject>-operability-review.md` (template-valid) recording verdict + findings + `open_items`, plus infrastructure-runway recommendations and observability implications.
- **Guard rails:** fix the root cause before retries / suppressions / bypasses; prefer narrow, reversible changes over pipeline rewrites; treat secrets, environment drift, rollout safety, readiness, and rollback clarity as first-class; separate mandatory deployment preconditions from optional improvements; never self-advance status or decide gates.

## Procedure

### Operability review (in Architectural Runway Extension)
Restate the deployable scope. Ask, in order: what changed, when it breaks, blast radius, whether rollback is safe, and the narrowest fix that proves or disproves the hypothesis. Record CI/CD, packaging, deployment, rollback, and environment-safety findings with severity. Emit `pass` (deployable as scoped), `concerns` (non-blocking risks as `open_items`), or `fail` (blocking operability defect → subject returns to its owner). When a delivery gap is really runway work, state it as an enabler Story or Feature. Control returns to `@release-train-engineer`.

## Done = handed back
Output committed + template-valid; every unresolved unknown recorded as an `open_items` entry per the [open-item ledger](../scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md#open-item-ledger) and routed to the dispatching orchestrator; workflow friction captured in the PI inspect-adapt ledger (`pi-M/inspect-adapt.md` §3b).
